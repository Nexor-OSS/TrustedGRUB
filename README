===== Overview =====

The original TrustedGRUB 1.1.5 source repository on SourceForge has not been maintained in some time. GitHub user cristianberneanu forked this original repository onto GitHub, and updated it to work on modern Linux distributions. Nexor has now forked cristianberneanu's repository in order to add additional support for the Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Linux distribution. This version of TrustedGRUB now builds on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, and a 'menu.lst' auto-generation script has been added in order to both ensure the TrustedGRUB measurements taken during boot are valid, and that the TPM-LUKS measurement calculation scripts will work correctly if TPM-LUKS is being used to take Trusted Boot into Secure Boot. 

===== Building a DEB (for Ubuntu 14.04) the easy way =====

We assume the target platform is Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64-bit. Ensure prerequisites are installed - build-essential, libc6-dev-i386, libncurses5:i386 (also runtime dep), glibc6-i386 (also runtime dep), checkinstall, alien. 

cd TrustedGRUB/
./build.sh

checkinstall

When checkinstall runs, it automatically builds a DEB package based on what 'make install' would otherwise have delivered. It may interactively request some information about the package when run - please complete at appropriate. Checkinstall will create a subdirectory called 'doc-pak', which will house the documentation to be included with the DEB package, and add some of the source documentation by default. Please ensure at least the README and LICENSE.nexor files are included here as a minimum, so that the DEB package is built with the appropriate documentation for use. 

Now we need to add a few other bits and pieces to the DEB, so that it provides a full installation. 

alien -g <checkinstall-pkg>.deb
cp postinst.ubuntu <alien-output-dir>/debian/postinst
cp util/zz-update-trustedgrub <alien-output-dir>/usr/local/share/grub/
cp util/create_sha1 <alien-output-dir>/usr/local/sbin/
cp util/verify_pcr <alien-output-dir>/usr/local/sbin/
mkdir -p <alien-output-dir>/boot/grub/
cp default <alien-output-dir>/boot/grub/
cd <alien-output-dir>
debian/rules binary
